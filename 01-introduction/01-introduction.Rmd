# Class etiquette

.pull-left-wide[
<br>

- Learning how to code can be challenging and might lead you out of your comfort zone. If you have problems with the pace of the course, let me and the TAs know. I expect your commitment to the class, but **I do not want anyone to fail.**
- You are all genuinely interested in data science. But there is also considerable variation in your backgrounds. This is how we like it! Some sessions will be more informative for you than others. If you feel bored, **look out for and help others**, or explore other corners of R you don't know yet.
- **Be respectful** to each other, all the time. This includes the TAs and me.
- **Ask questions** whenever you feel the need to do so!

# Types of data-driven research and their role for policy

.pull-left-small2[
## 1. Description
- What is the state of the world?
- What are the trends over time?
- What are the differences between groups?

## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **monitoring**
- "How many people consume misinformation online?"
- "How many people are unemployed in a certain district?"
- "How does the distribution of income vary across educational segments of the population?"
]

.pull-left-small2[
## 2. Explanation
- What is the effect of a policy?
- Does the effect vary across groups?
- What are the mechanisms behind the effect?

## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **evaluation**
- "Did the wage increase lead to a decrease in employment?"
- "Did the campaign affect the exposure to misinformation differently across groups?"
- "Why did the intervention not lead to the expected results?"
]

.pull-left-small2[
## 3. Prediction
- What is the path of an indicator?
- (When) will future events happen?
- What class does this observation most likely belong to?


## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **forecasting** but also **targeting** and **measurement**
- "Will there be conflict?"
- "How many people will be unemployed in a certain district next year?"
- "Which individuals are most likely to be affected by a policy?"

# The COMPAS algorithm to predict criminals' recidivism

.pull-left[
## Background

- Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) is a decision support tool developed by Northpointe (now Equivant) used by U.S. courts to **assess the likelihood of recidivism**
- Produced several scales (Pretrial release risk, General recidivism, Violent recidivism) based on factors such as age, criminal history, and substance abuse
- The algorithm is proprietary and its inner workings are not public

# The COMPAS algorithm to predict criminals' recidivism

.pull-left[
## The ProPublica and other investigations

- In 2016, ProPublica published an investigation showing that COMPAS was **biased against African Americans**
- **Bias:** The algorithm was more likely for African Americans to wrongly predict that defendants would re-offend.
- **Accuracy:** only 20% of people predicted to commit violent crimes actually went on to do so (in a later study estimated with 65%, still worse than a group of humans with little expertise)

# Why R and RStudio?

### Data science positivism

- Alongside Python, R has become the *de facto* language for data science.
  - See: [*The Impressive Growth of R*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), [*The Popularity of Data Science Software*](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)
- Open-source (free!) with a global user-base spanning academia and industry.
  - "Do you want to be a profit source or a cost center?"

--

### Bridge to multiple other programming environments, with statistics at heart

- Already has all of the statistics support, and is amazingly adaptable as a “glue” language to other
programming languages and APIs.
- The RStudio IDE and ecosystem allow for further, seemless integration.

--

### Path dependency

- It's also the language that I know best.
- (Learning multiple languages is a good idea, though.)

# Assignments and grading

| Component                           | Weight |
|:-|-:|
| 3(4) × homework assignments | pass/fail |
| 4(5) × online quizzes (5% each) | 20% |
| 1 × hackathon project       | 40% |
| 1 × in-class coding exam 	| 40% |

--

### Homework assignments 
- Your incentive to practice what you learn in class regularly!
- Each assignment is a mix of practical problems that are to be solved with R.
- The assignments are distributed via our own [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/113288627-intro-to-data-science-25-classroom).
- You are encouraged to collaborate, but everyone will hand in a separate solution.
- There will be 4 assignments (one every ~2 weeks), and you'll have to submit 3 of them to pass the course.
- You'll have one week to work on each assignment (deadline: Tuesdays at 9:30am).
- You submit your solutions via GitHub.
- Grading: pass/fail + feedback. Your solutions don't have to be perfect, but we want to see an individual effort.

### Online quizzes
- The short online quizzes will test your knowledge about the topics covered in class.
- There will be 5 quizzes and the 4 best will contribute to the final grade.
- You'll have one week to work on each assignment (deadline: Tuesdays at 9:30am).
- Note that quizzes will employ light negative grading. Usually a question is multiple choice, with an unknown number of correct items. The rationale is that if you select all options with not all of them being correct, you should not receive full credit (otherwise, in the absence of negative grading, selecting all answers would be the dominant strategy).

### Hackathon project
- On December 1, 14-16h, there will be a hackathon hosted at Hertie.
- At the hackathon itself, I'll introduce the data and provide an environment that should facilitate you getting started with the project and form groups of 3-4 students.
- After the hackathon project, you will get instructions . You will then have 72 hours to submit your solutions.
- The task is similar to the homework assignments but puts more emphasis on creative problem-solving using the tools and techniques you have learned in class.

### Can AI tools (LLM-based coding assistants) be used for assignments?

- Yes, but use them with care. You will not become an efficient programmer if you heavily rely on those tools without learning the basics.
- The Hertie School has a [guideline]((https://moodle.hertie-school.org/mod/url/view.php?id=130259) in place that address the use of AI tools in education installed .
- Some key elements from the guidelines:
  - "Students are required to include a Statement of Authorship and AI Use at the end of each written assignment (...), which states their authorship including the use of AI and the absence of plagiarism."
  - "[A]ll AI tools that have been used need to be specified in the Statement of Authorship."
  - "Students are responsible for factual errors and false references in their assignments,
even if these have been provided by AI tools that were properly disclosed. The assignment
will receive a grade penalty in such instances."
- "Non-disclosed or non-permitted (...) use of AI in assignments (...) is a
violation of good academic conduct."

### *Should* you use AI tools for this course?

- You are a student at one of the leading policy schools in the world. You decided to invest a considerable amount of time and money to learn about data science and public policy here. I think you're at the right place to do so.
- However, the learning is still on you. What is key is that you want to *understand* what you are doing. That will require you to think hard and work hard. And that is ultimately what you need to excel in a data-based job.
- Or, you could just rely on some commercial language model to do the hard work for you. If you do that, you will notice that the muscles you wanted to train will not grow.
- That is not to say that AI is not useful for coding. It is incredibly powerful. But it also often fails spectacularly. You need to understand what is going on under the hood to make it work for you.
- I am not here to discipline and punish. I have no interest in that. What I can do is provide you with an environment that facilitates learning and sets the right incentives. If you want to learn, I will help you. If you don't, I can't.
