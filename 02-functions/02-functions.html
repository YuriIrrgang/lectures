# What is the tidyverse?

.pull-left[
### R packages for data science

- Let's take it from the [tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/):

**"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."**

- It's the contribution of many people of the R community.
- [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) had a key role in shaping it by developing many of the core packages, such as `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `tibble`, and `stringr`.
- Install the complete tidyverse with:


``` r
R&gt; install.packages("tidyverse")
```

# Tidyverse packages

### Loading the tidyverse


``` r
R&gt; library(tidyverse)
```

- In addition to the currently 8 core packages, the tidyverse includes many others for more specialized usage.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
- We'll use several of these additional packages during the remainder of this course (e.g., the `rvest` package for web scraping). Bear in mind that these packages will have to be loaded separately.
- See [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) for an overview, or just in R directly:




``` r
R&gt; tidyverse_packages()
```

```
    [1] "broom"         "conflicted"    "cli"           "dbplyr"        "dplyr"         "dtplyr"        "forcats"      
    [8] "ggplot2"       "googledrive"   "googlesheets4" "haven"         "hms"           "httr"          "jsonlite"     
   [15] "lubridate"     "magrittr"      "modelr"        "pillar"        "purrr"         "ragg"          "readr"        
   [22] "readxl"        "reprex"        "rlang"         "rstudioapi"    "rvest"         "stringr"       "tibble"       
   [29] "tidyr"         "xml2"          "tidyverse"
```

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It also includes a *lot* of dependencies upon installation. This is a matter of some [controversy](http://www.tinyverse.org/).

# Tidyverse vs. base R

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="pics/great-story-base-R.jpeg" width=700&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

# Tidyverse vs. base R: what's the difference?

- Both are compatible. You can wrangle your data with `dplyr`, plot it with `ggplot2`, and model it with yet another package.
- Ultimately, the tidyverse is just a bunch of (hugely popular!) packages that share design principles.
- Often, tidyverse packages don't reinvent the wheel. Instead, they offer more consistency in naming, arguments, and output (among other things).
- For instance, compare function naming principles (`tidyverse::snake_case` vs `base::period.case` rule; more on these conventions later) in these examples:

| tidyverse  |  base |
|---|---|
| `?readr::read_csv`  | `?utils::read.csv` |
|  `?dplyr::if_else` |  `?base::ifelse` |
|  `?tibble::tibble` |  `?base::data.frame` |

- If you call up the above examples, you'll see that the tidyverse alternative typically offers some enhancements or other useful options (and sometimes restrictions) over its base counterpart.

--

- And **remember:** There are (almost) always multiple ways to achieve a single goal in R.

# Tidyverse vs. base R: what to use?

.pull-left[
### Stories from the past

- When I started to learn R ~16 years ago, there was no tidyverse. The learning curve felt much steeper. I often switched back to Stata for data wrangling.
- As the tidyverse grew, R became more convenient to use for the entire research pipeline.
- There's simply no need for you to live through the same pain.

### Why we start with the tidyverse

- Because [clever people think it's the right way](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/).
- Documentation + community support are great.
- Having a consistent syntax makes it easier to learn.
]

.pull-right[

### You still will want to check out base R alternatives later

- Base R is extremely flexible and powerful (and stable).
- There are some things that you'll have to venture outside of the tidyverse for.
- A combination of tidyverse and base R is often the best solution to a problem.
- Excellent base R data manipulation tutorial [here](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR).

# Tidy programming basics

"Tidy programming" is not a strictly defined practice in the tidyverse. However, there are some common programming strategies that help you keep your code and workflow tidy. These include:

- Pipes (you already learned how to use them ✅)
- User-generated functions
- Functional programming with `purrr`

--

The latter two are extremely helpful - in particular when you are confronted with iterative tasks.

--

We will now learn the basics of creating your own functions and functional programming with R. There is much more to learn about these topics, so we will revisit them as the course progresses.


---
# Functional programming

R is a functional programming (FP) language. As Hadley Wickham puts it in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html):

&gt; This means that it provides many tools for the creation and manipulation of functions. In particular, R has what’s known as first-class functions. You can do anything with functions that you can do with vectors: you can assign them to variables, store them in lists, pass them as arguments to other functions, create them inside functions, and even return them as the result of a function.

R encourages you to use and build your own functions to solve problems. Often, this implies decomposing a large problem into small pieces, and solving each of them with independent functions.

There is much more to learn about functions and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). Useful resources include:

- The chapter on functions in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html).
- The section on functional programming in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html).
- The [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) book. In a way, bundling functions in a package is sometimes the next logical step.

# Creating functions

### Why creating functions?

That's a legit question. There are 22,000+ **packages** on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (and many, many more on GitHub and other repositories) containing zillions of functions. Why should you create yet another one?
- Every data science project is unique. There are problems only you have to solve. 
- For problems that are repetitive, you'll quickly look for options to automate the task.
- Functions are a great way to automate.

--

### Examples where creating functions makes sense

--

1. You want to scrape thousands of websites. This implies multiple steps, from downloading to parsing and cleaning. All these steps can be achieved with existing functions, but the fine-tuning is specific to the set of websites. You build one (or a set of) scraping functions that take the websites as input and return a cleaned data frame ready to be analyzed.

--

2. You want to estimate not one but multiple models on your dataset. The models vary both in terms of data input and specification. Again, based on existing modeling functions you tailor your own, allowing you to run all these models automatically and to parse the results into one clean data frame.

# Basic syntax

.pull-left[
Writing your own function in R is easy with the `function()` function&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The basic syntax is as follows:


``` r
R&gt; my_func &lt;- function(ARGUMENTS) {
+     OPERATIONS
+     return(VALUE)
+   }
```

Writing your own function in R is easy with the `function()` function&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The basic syntax is as follows:


``` r
*R&gt; my_func &lt;- function(ARGUMENTS) {
+     OPERATIONS
+     return(VALUE)
+   }
```

- We write functions to apply them later. So, we have to give them a name. Here, we name it "`my_func`".
- Also, our function (almost) always needs input, plus we want to specify how exactly the function should behave. We can use arguments for this, which are specified as arguments of the `function()` function.

+     return(VALUE)

- Next, we specify anything we want the function to do.
- This comes in between curly brackets, `{...}`.
- Importantly, we can recycle arguments by calling them by their name.

*+     return(VALUE)

- Finally, we specify what the function should return. 
- This could be a list, data.frame, vector, sentence - or anything else really.
- Note that R automatically returns the final object that is written (not: assigned!) in your function by default. Still, my recommendation is that you get into the habit of assigning the return object(s) explicitly with `return()`.

- We now take up the argument `temp_F`, do something with it, and store the output in a new object, `temp_C`.
- Importantly, that object only lives within the function. When the function is run, we cannot access it from the environment.

# Functions: default argument values, if(), else()

.pull-left[

Let's make the function a bit more complex, but also more fun.

- By giving `from` a default value (`"f"`), we ensure that the function returns valid output when only the key input, `temp`, is provided.
- `if() {...}` allows us to make conditional statements. Here, we test for the validity of the input for argument `from`.
- If the condition is not met, the function breaks and prints a message.
- We `else()` we specify what to do if the `if()` condition is not met.
- Make R more talkative with `message()`. Future-You will like it!

# Anonymous functions

In R, functions are objects in their own right. They aren’t automatically bound to a name. If you choose not to give the function a name, you get an **anonymous function**. You use an anonymous function when it’s not worth the effort to give it a name.

--

**Examples:**


``` r
R&gt; map(char_vec, function(x) paste(x, collapse = "|")) 
R&gt; integrate(function(x) sin(x) ^ 2, 0, pi)
```

# Anonymous functions

In R, functions are objects in their own right. They aren’t automatically bound to a name. If you choose not to give the function a name, you get an **anonymous function**. You use an anonymous function when it’s not worth the effort to give it a name.

As of `R 4.1.0`, there's a new shorthand syntax for anonymous functions: `\(x)`.

--

**Example:**


``` r
R&gt; (function (x) {paste(x, 'is awesome!')})('Data science') # old syntax
```

```
   [1] "Data science is awesome!"
```

``` r
R&gt; (\(x) {paste(x, 'is awesome!')})('Data science') # new syntax
```

```
   [1] "Data science is awesome!"

# `...` (Dot-dot-dot)

Functions can have a special argument `...` (pronounced *dot-dot-dot*). In other programming languages, this type of argument is often called varargs (short for variable arguments), or ellipsis. With it, a function can take any number of additional arguments. That is potentially very powerful!

A common application is to use `...` to pass those additional arguments on to another function.

``` r
R&gt; my_list_generator &lt;- function(y, z) {

# Writing functions with ChatGPT

.pull-left-wide[
Not every function you plan to write is unique, nor is every problem you want to solve functionally. 

ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot and other AI-based coding tools can help you a lot in finding functional solutions you can describe but not verbalize (yet). 

I encourage you to use AI for this purpose, but be aware of the necessity to (a) debug and (b) assign credit where due.

**Let's try it out with one of the following prompts:**

- *Write an R function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a character vector.*
- *Write an R function that allows me to play one round of black jack.*

# Taming chaos

.pull-left[
In the data science workflow, there are two sorts of **surprises** and cognitive stress:

1. Analytical (often good)
2. Infrastructural (almost always bad)

**Analytical surprise** is when you learn something from or about the data.

**Infrastructural surprise** is when you discover that:

- You can't find what you did before.
- The analysis code breaks.
- The report doesn't compile.
- The collaborator can't run your code.

Good project management lets you focus on the right kind of stress.

# Keeping Future-you happy

- It’s often tempting to set up a project assuming that you will be the only person working on it, e.g. as homework.
- That’s almost never true.
- Coauthors and collaborators happen to the best of us.
- Even if not, there's someone else who you always have to keep happy: Future-you.
- Future-you is really the one you organize your projects for.
- They are who you use version control for (see later).
- Most importantly, they are who will enjoy the fruits of your data science labor, or have to fight back your chaos.
- So, be kind to Future-you. Establish a good workflow. You'll thank yourself later.

# Project setup

You should **always** think in terms of projects.

A project is a **self-contained unit of data science work** that can be

- Shared
- Recreated by others
- Packaged
- Dumped

--

A project contains

- Content, e.g., raw data, processed data, scripts, functions, documents and other output
- Metadata, e.g., information about tools for running it (required libraries, compilers), version history

--

For R projects

- Projects are folders/directories.
- Metadata is the [RStudio project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) (`.Rproj`) files (perhaps augmented with the output of [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for dependency management) and `.git`.


---

# Setup: the folder structure

.pull-left-wide[

## Structuring your working directory

- One folder contains everything inside it.
- Directories keep things separate that should be separated.
- You decide on the fundamental structure. The project decides on the details.

## Further thoughts

- Ideally, your project folder can be relocated without problem.
- Keep input separate from output. Definitely separate raw from processed data!
- Structure should be capable of evolution. More data, cases, models, output formats shouldn't be a problem.

# Setup: the paths

.pull-left[
## Good paths

- All internal paths are relative.
- They are invariant to moving/sharing the project.
- Examples:
  - `"preprocessing.R"`
  - `"figures/model-1.png"`
  - `"../data/survey.RDa"`
  
## Bad paths

- Using `setwd()` is bad practice 99% of the times.
- Absolute paths are bad paths. Don't feed functions with paths like `"/Users/me/data/thing.sav"`.
- Those paths will not work outside your computer (or maybe not even there, some days/weeks/months ahead).
]

--

.pull-right[

## The working directory

- Set it manually once per session (do `Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory`). Then all your good paths will "just work".
- Better yet, get it right automatically by opening RStudio with clicking on the script you want to work with. This will set the location of the script as working directory (which should be your working assumption, too).
- Even better yet, have the metadata set it for you:
  - Open your session by opening (choosing, clicking on) `myproject.Rproj` 
  - Then you’ll get the path set for you. 
- That's probably better than the previous option because you might not want your `code` directory to be the working directory.
]


---

# Setup: the code structure

## Naming scripts

- Files should have short, descriptive names that indicate their purpose.
- I recommend the use of telling verbs.
- Names should only include letters and numbers with dashes `-` or underscores `_` to separate words.
- Use numbering to indicate the order in which files should be run:
  - `0-setup.R`
  - `1-import-data.R`
  - `2-preprocess-data.R`
  - `3-describe-uptake.R`
  - `4-analyze-uptake.R`
  - `5-analyze-experiment.R`
  
--

## Modularizing scripts

- Write short, modular scripts. Every script serves a purpose in your pipeline.
- This makes things easier to debug.
- At the beginning of a script you might want to document input and output.



---

# Setup: the code structure (cont.)

## Talk to Future-you

- Describe your code, e.g. by starting with a description of what it does. If you comment/describe a lot, consider using an R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file instead of a simple `.R` script.
- Put the setup first (e.g., `library()` and `source()`).
- You might want to outsource the loading of packages to a separate script that is imported in the first step (`source("functions.R")`) or just declared the first script in the pipeline.
- Always comment more than you usually do.

--

## Structuring your code

- Even with modularized code, scripts can become long. Structure helps to keep an overview.
- Use commented lines as section/subsection heads.
- RStudio creates a "table of contents" when you name your code chunks as follows (`#` followed by title and `---`):


``` r
R&gt; # Import data --------------
R&gt; 
R&gt; dat &lt;- read_csv("dat.csv")
```



---

# Setup: the rest

.pull-left[

## More things to consider 

- There'd be more to say on how to establish a good project workflow, including how to
  - store/organize raw and derived data,
  - deal with output in form of graphs and tables,
  - link everything together from start (project setup) to finish (knitting the report)
  - separate coding for the record and experimental coding.
- But there's limited value in teaching you all that upfront.
- The truth is: You'll likely refine your own workflow over time. I just saved you some initial pain (hopefully).
- Do check out other people's experiences and opinions, e.g.,  [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/08/structuring-r-projects/) or  [here](https://kdestasio.github.io/post/r_best_practices/).

# Coding style: the basics

### Why adhere to a particular style of coding?

- It reduces the number of arbitrary decisions you have to consciously make during coding. We make an arbitrary decision (convention) once, not always ad hoc.
- It provides consistency.
- It makes code easier to write.
- It makes code easier to read, especially in the long term (i.e. two days after you've closed a script).
	
--

### What are questions of style?

- Questions of style are a matter of opinion.
- We will mostly follow Hadley Wickham’s opinion as expressed in the "[tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)".
- We'll consider how to
  - name,
  - comment,
  - structure, and
  - write.

# Naming files

- Code file names should be meaningful and end in `.R`.
- Avoid using special characters in file names. Stick with numbers, letters, dashes (`-`), and underscores (`_`).
- Some examples:

```bash
# Good
fit_models.R
utility_functions.R

# Bad
fit models.R
foo.r
stuff.r
```

- If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers: 

```bash
00_download.R
01_explore.R
...
09_model.R
10_visualize.R
```

# Naming objects and variables

.pull-left[
- There are various conventions of how to write phrases without spaces or punctuation. Some of these have been adapted in programming, such as [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [PascalCase](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase), or [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).
- The [`tidyverse`](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#object-names) way: Object and variable names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Examples:

```bash
# Good
day_one # snake_case
day_1 # snake_case

# Less good
dayOne # camelCase
DayOne # PascalCase
day.one # dot.case

# Dysfunctional
day-one # kebab-case

# Naming functions

- In addition to following the general advice for object names, strive to use verbs for function names:

```bash
# Good
add_row()
permute()

# Bad
row_adder()
permutation()
```
- Also, try avoiding function names that already exist, in particular those that come with a loaded package.
- This often implies a trade-off between shortness and uniqueness. In any case, you would try to avoid situations that force you disambiguate functions with the same name (as in `dplyr::select`; see ["R packages"](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-mindset-background.html#sec-dependencies-namespace)).
- Check out this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)) or this [Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17326185/what-are-the-different-kinds-of-cases) for more background on naming conventions in programming!

# Commenting on things *cont.*

.pull-left[
### General advice

- Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: `# `
- Use comments to record important findings and analysis decisions.
- If you need comments to explain what your code is doing, consider rewriting your code to be clearer. 
- But: comments can work well as "sub-headlines".
- If you discover that you have more comments than code, consider switching to R Markdown.
- (Longer) comments generally work better if they get their own line.


``` r
R&gt; # define job status
R&gt; dat$at_work &lt;- dat$job %in% c(2, 3)

```
]

.pull-right[
### Giving structure

- Use commented lines together with dashes to break up your file into easily readable chunks.
- RStudio automatically detects these chunks and turns them into sections in the script outline.

R&gt; 
R&gt; # input

# Other stuff

.pull-left[
- Use **spaces** generously, but not too generously. Always put a space after a comma, never before, just like in regular English.
- Use `&lt;-`, not `=`, for **assignment**.
- For **logical operators**, prefer `TRUE` and `FALSE` over `T` and `F`.
- To facilitate readability, **keep your lines short**. Strive to limit your code to about 80 characters per line.
- If a **function call is too long** to fit on a single line, use one line each for the function name, each argument, and the closing bracket.
- Use **pipes**. When you use them, they should always have a space before it, and should usually be followed by a new line.
