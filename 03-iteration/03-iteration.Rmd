# Iteration

### The ubiquity of iteration

- Often we have to run the same task over and over again, with minor variations. Examples:
  - Standardize values of a variable
  - Recode all numeric variables in a dataset
  - Running multiple models with varying covariate sets
- A benefit of scripting languages in data (as opposed to point-and-click solutions) is that we can easily automate the process of iteration

--

### Ways to iterate

- A simple approach is to copy-and-paste code with minor modifications (→ "[duplicate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code)", → "[copy-and-paste programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-and-paste_programming)"). This is lazy, error-prone, not very efficient, and violates the "[Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)" (DRY) principle. 
- In R, [vectorization](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/perf-improve.html#vectorise), that is applying a function to every element of a vector at once, already does a good share of iteration for us.
- `for()` [loops](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration.html) are intuitive and straightforward to build, but sometimes not very efficient.
- Finally, we learned about functions. Now, we learn how to unleash their power by applying them to anything we interact with in R at scale.

# A simple example

.pull-left[

## Task

Say we want to double each element in a numeric vector, `x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`. Here are some different approaches to achieve this:

### 1. Manually (sometimes: copying and pasting code)

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x_doubled <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
```

### 2. Vectorization

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x_doubled <- x * 2
x_doubled
```
]

--

.pull-right[
### 3. `for()` loop

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x_doubled <- numeric(length(x))
for (i in seq_along(x)) {
  x_doubled[i] <- x[i] * 2
}
x_doubled
```

### 4. Using `purrr`

```{r}
library(purrr)
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x_doubled <- map_dbl(x, ~ .x * 2)
x_doubled
```
]




---

# Iteration with purrr

.pull-left-wide[

### The tidyverse way to iterate

- For *real* functional programming in base R, we can use the `*apply()` family of functions (`lapply()`, `sapply()`, etc.). See [here](https://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2010/08/20/a-brief-introduction-to-apply-in-r/) for an excellent summary.
- In the tidyverse, this functionality comes with the `purrr` package.
- At its core is the `map*()` family of functions. 


### How `purrr` works

- The idea is always to **apply** a function to **x**, where x can be a list, vector, data.frame, or something more complex. 
- The output is then returned as output of a pre-defined type (e.g., a list).

</div>
]

---

# Iteration with purrr: map()

The `map*()` functions all follow a similar syntax:

<div align="center">
`map(.x, .f, ...)`
</div>

We use it to apply a function `.f` to each piece in `.x`. Additional arguments to `.f` can be passed on in `...`.

--

For instance, if we want to identify the object class of every column of a data.frame, we can write:

```{r}
map(starwars, class)
```


---

# Iteration with purrr: map() *cont.*

By default, `map()` returns a list. But we can also use other `map*()` functions to give us an atomic vector of an indicated type (e.g., `map_int()` to return an integer vector, or `map_vec()` to return a vector that is the simplest common type).

Going back to the previous example, we can also use `map_chr()`, which returns a character vector:

```{r}
map_chr(starwars, class)
```

--

The `purrr` function set is quite comprehensive. Be sure to check out the [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/purrr.pdf) and the [tutorials](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/index.html). You'll survive without `purrr` but you probably don't want to live without it. Together with `dplyr` it's easily the most powerful package for data wrangling in the tidyverse. If you master it, it will save you a lot of time and headaches.

# Automation

.pull-left-wide2[
### Motivation

- We spend [too much time](https://itchronicles.com/technology/repetitive-tasks-cost-5-trillion-annually/) on repetitive tasks.
- We're already automating using scripts that bundle multiple commands! Next step: The pipeline as a series of scripts and commands.
- Good pipelines are modular. But you don't want to trigger 10 scripts sequentially by hand.
- Some tasks are to be repeated on a regular basis (schedule).

### When automation makes sense

- The input is variable but the process of turning input into output is highly standardized.
- You use a diverse set of software to produce the output.
- Others (humans, machines) are supposed to run the analyses.
- Time saved by automation >> Time needed to automate.
]

.pull-right-small2[
### Different ways of doing it

We will consider automation

- using **R**,
- using the **Shell** and **RScript**,
- using **make**, and
- using dedicated **scheduling tools**.

# Thinking in pipelines

.pull-left[
### Key characteristics
- Pipelines make complex projects easier to handle because they break up a monolithic script into **discrete, manageable chunks**.
- If properly done, each stage of the pipeline defines its input and its outputs.
- Pipeline modules **do not modify their inputs** (*idempotence*). Rerunning one module produces the same results as the previous run.

### Key advantages
- When you modify one stage of the pipeline, you only have to rerun the downstream, dependent stages.
- Division of labor is straightforward.
- Modules tend to be a lot easier to debug.

# A data science pipeline is a graph

.pull-left-small2[
### Wait what
- Scripts and data files are vertices of the graph.
- Dependencies between stages are edges of the graph.
- Pipelines are not necessarily DAGS. Recursive routines are imaginable (but to be avoided?).
- Also, scripts are not necessarily hierarchical (e.g., multiple different modeling approaches of the same data in different scripts).
- An automation script gives *one* order in which you can successfully run the pipeline.

# Automation using pipelines in R

.pull-left[
### Motivation and usage
- The `source()` function reads and parses R code from a file or connection. 
- We can build a pipeline by sourcing scripts sequentially.
- This pipeline is usually stored in a "master/main" script.
- The removal of previous work is optional and maybe redundant. Often the data is overwritten by default.
- It is recommended that the individual scripts are (partial) standalones, i.e. that they import all data they need by default (loading the packages could be considered an exception). 
- Note that as long as the environment is not reset, it remains intact across scripts, which is a potential source of error and confusion.
]

.pull-right[
### Example

The master script `master.R`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## clean out any previous work
outputs <- c("lotr_raw.tsv",
	          "lotr_clean.tsv",
              list.files(pattern = "*.png$"))
file.remove(outputs)

## run scripts
source("00-packages.R")
source("01-download-data.R")
source("02-process-data.R")
source("03-plot.R")
```

# Automation using the Shell and Rscript

.pull-left[
### Motivation and usage
- Alternatively to using an R master script, we can also run the pipeline from the command line.
- Note that here, the environments don't carry over across `Rscript` calls. The scripts definitely have to run in a standalone fashion (i.e., load packages, import all necessary data, etc.).
- The working directory should be set either in the script(s) or in the shell with `cd`.
]

--

.pull-right[
### Example

The master script `master.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
cd /Users/simonmunzert/github/examples/02-automation-shell-rscript
set -eux
Rscript 01-download-data.R
Rscript 02-process-data.R
Rscript 03-plot.R
```

The `set` command allows to adjust some base shell parameters:
- `-e`: Stop at first error
- `-u`: Undefined variables are an error
- `-x`: Print each command as it is run

For more information on `set`, see [here](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/seth.html).

# Automation using Make

.pull-left-vwide[
### Motivation and usage
- [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29) is an automation tool that allows us to specify and manage build processes.
- It is commonly run via the shell.
- At the heart of a make operation is the `makefile` (or `Makefile`, `GNUmakefile`), a script which serves as a recipe for the building process.
- A `makefile` is written following a particular syntax and in a declarative fashion.
- Conceptually, the recipe describes which files are built how and using what input.

### Advantages of Make
- It looks at which files you have and automatically figures out how to create the files that you have. For complex pipelines this "automation of the automation process" can be very helpful.
- While shell scripts give *one* order in which you can successfully run the pipeline, Make will figure out the parts of the pipeline (and their order) that are needed to build a desired target.

# Automation using Make (cont.)

.pull-left-small[
### Basic syntax

Each batch of lines indicates 
- a file to be created (the target),
- the files it depends on (the prerequisites), and 
- set of commands needed to construct the target from the dependent files.

Dependencies propagate.
- To create any of the `png` figures, we need `lotr_clean.tsv`.
- If this file changes, the `png`s change as well when they're built.

### Example `makefile`

```bash
all: lotr_clean.tsv barchart-words-by-race.png words-histogram.png

lotr_raw.tsv:

lotr_clean.tsv: lotr_raw.tsv 02-process-data.R
	Rscript 02-process-data.R

barchart-words-by-race.png: lotr_clean.tsv 03-plot.R

### Getting Make to run

- Using the command line, go into the directory for your project.
- Create the `Makefile` file.
- The most basic Make commands are `make all` and `make clean` which builds (or deletes) all output as specified in the script.

- Many, many more are available on GitHub and other code sharing platforms.
- R has a vivid community that continuous to create and build extensions and maintain the existing environment. Many of them have much more training and time to invest in software development.
- So, why should we (and with that I mean YOU) write yet another R package?

# Why create another R package?

.pull-left-wide[
1. **Thinking in functions.** R is a functional programming language, and packages bundle functions. Thinking of projects as packages is consistent with a functional mindset.

2. **Automation and transportability.** By turning tasks into functions, you save repetitive typing, keep frequently-used code together, and let code travel across projects.

3. **Collaboration and transparency.** Packages are ideal to make functionality available to others, but also to let others contribute. As a side effect, it nudges you to document your functions properly and gives you the opportunity to let others review and improve your code easily. 

4. **Visibility and productization.** Publishing code in packages is potentially giving your project a big boost in visibility. Also, it is more likely to be perceived as a product than an insular project.

# Writing R packages - FAQ

.pull-left[
### Is learning this worth the time?

Yes.

### Where can I learn more?

Glad that you're asking! There's tons of materials out there. Apart from the used [tutorial](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/r-package/) and the [R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/), have a look at the [devtools cheatsheet](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/package-development.pdf) and another overview over at [RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486488-Developing-Packages-with-the-RStudio-IDE). Knowing how to [turn a package into a website](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/) within minutes is fascinating, too. 

### When do we need a package, and when is a GitHub repo simply enough?

Do you think of your work as a project or a product? If it's the latter, maybe a package is right for you. (But... a research paper is also a product, right? 🤯)

# Scheduling scripts and processes

.pull-left-wide[
### Motivation
- So far, we have automated data science pipelines.
- But the execution of these pipelines still needs to be triggered.
- In some cases, it is desirable to also **automate the initialization** of R scripts (or any processes for that matter) **on a regular basis**, e.g. weekly, daily, on logon, etc.
- This makes particular sense when you have moving parts in your pipeline (most likely: data).

### Common scenarios for scheduling

1. You fetch data from the web on a regular basis (e.g., via scraping scripts or APIs).
2. You generate daily/weekly/monthly reports/tweets based on changing data.
3. You build an alert control system informing you about anomalies in a database.

### Scheduling options
- Schedule tasks on Windows with [Windows Task Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler).
- Manage them via a GUI (→ Control Panel) or the command line using `schtasks.exe`.
- The R package [`taskscheduleR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taskscheduleR/vignettes/taskscheduleR.html) provides a programmable R interface to the WTS.

### Scheduling options
- On macOS you can schedule background jobs using [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) and [`launchd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd).

- The R package [`cronR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cronR/index.html) provides a programmable R interface.
- `cron` syntax for more complex scheduling:

# What's debugging?

.pull-left[
### Straight from the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)

"Debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems."

### A famous (yet not the first) bug:

The term "bug" was used in an account by computer pioneer [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) (see on the right). While she was working on a [Mark II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_II) computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were "debugging" the system. This bug was carefully removed and taped to the log book (see on the right).

# Why debugging matters

.pull-left-wide[
The Wikipedia [list of software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_bugs) with significant consequences is growing and you don't want to be on it. 

NASA software engineers are [famous for producing bug-free code](https://www.bugsplat.com/blog/less-serious/why-nasa-code-doesnt-crash/). This was learned the hard and costly way though. Some highlights from space:

- 1962: A booster went off course during launch, resulting in the [destruction of NASA Mariner 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkOOazEJcUc) . This was the result of the failure of a transcriber to notice an overbar in a handwritten specification for the guidance program, resulting in an incorrect formula the FORTRAN code.
- 1999: [NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter was destroyed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcYkOh4nweE), due to software on the ground generating commands based on parameters in pound-force (lbf) rather than newtons (N)
- 2004: [NASA's Spirit rover became unresponsive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V54LRRJaGk) on January 21, 2004, a few weeks after landing on Mars. Engineers found that too many files had accumulated in the rover's flash memory (the problem could be fixed though by deleting unnecessary files, and the Rover lived happily ever after. Until it [froze to death in 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)).

.footnote[<sup>1</sup>Do you get an error message you don't understand? That's good news actually, because the really nasty bugs come without errors. ]

.pull-left-wide2[
According to [this analysis](https://github.com/noamross/zero-dependency-problems/blob/master/misc/stack-overflow-common-r-errors.md), the most common error types in R are:<sup>1</sup>

1. `Could not find function` errors, usually caused by typos or not loading a required package.
2. `Error in if` errors, caused by non-logical data or missing values passed to R's `if` conditional statement.
3. `Error in eval` errors, caused by references to objects that don't exist.
4. `Cannot open` errors, caused by attempts to read a file that doesn't exist or can't be accessed.
5. `no applicable method` errors, caused by using an object-oriented function on a data type it doesn't support.
6. `subscript out of bounds` errors, caused by trying to access an element or dimension that doesn't exist
7. Package errors caused by being unable to install, compile or load a package.
]

.pull-right-small2[
Whenever you see an error message, start by [googling](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=Error+in+interpretative_method+%3A+%20+%20could+not+find+function+%22interpretative_method%22&iie=1) it. Improve your chances of a good match by removing any variable names or values that are specific to your problem. Also, look for [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) posts and list of answers.

# Reset

.pull-left[
- If at first you don't succeed, try exactly the same thing again.
- Have you tried turning it off and on again?
- Do you use `rm(list = ls())`? Don't. Packages remain loaded, options and environment variables set, ... all possible sources of error!
- A fresh start clears the workspace, resets options, environment variables, and the path.
- While we're at it, check out James Wade's advice ["How I set up RStudio for Efficient Coding" (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-r-AWR3-Es).

# Debug

### Make the error repeatable. 

- Execute the code many times as you consider and reject hypotheses. To make that iteration as quick possible, it’s worth some upfront investment to make the problem both easy and fast to reproduce.
- Work with reproducible and minimal examples by removing innocuous code and simplifying data.
- Consider automated testing. Add some nearby tests to ensure that existing good behaviour is preserved. 

### Track the error down.

- Execute code step by step and inspect intermediate outputs. 
- Adopt the scientific method: Generate hypotheses, design experiments to test them, and record your results. 

### Once found, fix the error and test it.

- Ensure you haven’t introduced any new bugs in the process. 
- Make sure to carefully record the correct output, and check against the inputs that previously failed.
- Reset and run again to make sure everything still works. 


---
# Deter

.pull-left-wide2[

### Defensive programming

- **Pay attention.** Do results make sense? Do they look different from previous results? Why?
- **Know what you're doing**, and what you're expecting.
  - Avoid functions that return different types of output depending on their input, e.g., `[]` and `sapply()`.
  - Be strict about what you accept (e.g., only scalars). 
  - Avoid functions that use non-standard evaluation (e.g., `with()`)
- **Fail fast**.
  - As soon as something wrong is discovered, signal an error. 
  - Add tests (e.g., with the `testthat` package).
  - Practice good condition/exception handling, e.g., with `try()` and `tryCatch()`. 
  - Write error messages for humans.

]

.pull-right-small3[
### Transparency

- Collaborate! [Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) is an established software development technique that increases code robustness. It also works [from remote](https://ivelasq.rbind.io/blog/vscode-live-share/).
- Be transparent! Let others access your code and comment on it.

# Strategies to debug your R code

Sometimes the mistake in your code is hard to diagnose, and googling doesn't help. Here are a couple of strategies to debug your code:

- Use `traceback()` to determine where a given error is occurring.

- Output diagnostic information in code with `print()`, `cat()` or `message()` statements.

- Use `browser()` to open an interactive debugger before the error

- Use `debug()` to automatically open a debugger at the start of a function call.

- Use `trace()` to make temporary code modifications inside a function that you don't have easy access to.


---
# Locating errors with traceback()

.pull-left[

### Motivation and usage
- When an error occurs with an unidentifiable error message or an error message that you are in principle familiar with but cannot locate its sources, the `traceback()` function comes in handy.
- The `traceback()` function prints the sequence of calls that led to an uncaught error.
- The `traceback()` output reads from bottom to top.
- Note that errors caught via `try()` or `tryCatch()` do not generate a traceback!
-  If you’re calling code that you `source()`d into R, the traceback will also display the location of the function, in the form `filename.r#linenumber`. 
]

--

.pull-right[
### Example

In the call sequence below, the execution of `g()` triggers an error:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
f <- function(x) x + 1
g <- function(x) f(x)
g("a")
```

```r 
#> Error in x + 1 : non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

Doing the traceback reveals that the function call f(x) is what lead to the error:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
traceback()
```

```r 
#> 2: f(x) at #1
#> 1: g("a")
```
]

---
# Interactive debugging with browser()

.pull-left[
### Motivation and usage
- Sometimes, you need more information than the precise location of an error in a function to fix it. 
- The interactive debugger lets you pause the run of a function and interactively explore its state.
- Two options to enter the interactive debugger: 
  1. Through RStudio's "Rerun with Debug" tool, shown to the right of an error message.
  2. You can insert a call to `browser()` into the function at the stage where you want to pause, and re-run the function.
- In either case, you’ll end up in an interactive environment inside the function where you can run arbitrary R code to explore the current state. You’ll know when you’re in the interactive debugger because you get a special prompt, `Browse[1]>`. 
]

--

.pull-right[
### Example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
h <- function(x) x + 3
g <- function(b) {
  browser() #<<
  h(b)
}
g(10)
```

Some useful things to do are:

1. Use `ls()` to determine what objects are available in the current
   environment.
2. Use `str()`, `print()` etc. to examine the objects.
3. Use `n` to evaluate the next statement.
4. Use `s`: like `n` but also step into function calls.
5. Use `where` to print a stack trace (→ traceback).
6. Use `c` to exit debugger and continue execution.
7. Use `Q` to exit debugger and return to the R prompt.

# Debugging other peoples' code


.pull-left[
### Motivation
- Sometimes the error is outside your code in a package you're using, you might still want to be able to debug.
- Two options:
  1. Get a local version of the package code and debug as if it were your own.
  2. Use functions which which allow you to start a browser in existing functions, including `recover()` and `debug()`.
]

.pull-right[
]



---
# Debugging other peoples' code (cont.)

.pull-left-small[
### Motivation
- `recover()` serves as an alternative error handler which you activate by calling `options(error = recover)`.
- You can then select from a list of current calls to browse.
- `options(error = NULL)` turns off this debugging mode again.
- A simpler alternative is `options(error = browser)`, but this only allows you to browse the call where the error occurred.
]

--

.pull-right-wide[
### Example

- Activate debugging mode; then execute (flawed) function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(error = recover) #<<
lm(mpg ~ wt, data = "mtcars")
```

```r 
Error in model.frame.default(formula = mpg ~ wt, data = "mtcars", drop.unused.levels = TRUE) 
 'data' must be a data.frame, environment, or list
 
Enter a frame number, or 0 to exit   

1: lm(mpg ~ wt, data = "mtcars")
2: eval(mf, parent.frame())
3: eval(mf, parent.frame())

Selection: 
```

- Deactivate debugging mode: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(error = NULL) #<<
```
]

---
# Debugging other peoples' code (cont.)

.pull-left[
### Motivation
- `debug()` activates the debugger on any function, including those in packages (see on the right). `undebug()` deactivates the debugger again.
- Some functions in another package are easier to find than others. There are
  - *exported* functions which are available outside of a package and
  - *internal* functions which are only available within a package.
- To find (and debug) exported functions, use the `::` syntax, as in `ggplot2::ggplot`.
- To find un-exported functions, use the `:::` syntax, as in `ggplot2:::check_required_aesthetics`.
]

--

.pull-right[
### Example

- Activate debugging mode for `lm()` function; then execute function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
debug(stats::lm) #<<
lm(mpg ~ weight, data = "mtcars")
```

- Interactive debugging mode for `lm()` is entered; use the common `browser()` functionality to navigate:

```r 
debugging in: lm(mpg ~ weight, data = mtcars)
debug: {
    ret.x <- x
    ...
Browse[2]> 
```

- Deactivate debugging mode: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
undebug(stats::lm) #<<
```
